# Memory Match
It is a simple Memory Match game developed in html, css and javascript <br>
Simple javascripts methods that I used for developing this web app <br>
1.  ` document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',()=>{
    .... 
} `  <br>
i.e the event listener when the dom has loaded.
All the methods have been writter inside this listner.<br>
2.  ` card.addEventListener("click",cardClicked)  ` <br>
i.e the click event listener when the ` card` element is clicked. <br>
3.  ` setTimeout(checkmatch,500); ` <br> for wating for 500ms before procedding further i.e sort od delay. <br>
_the logic is pretty straight forward and simple_
